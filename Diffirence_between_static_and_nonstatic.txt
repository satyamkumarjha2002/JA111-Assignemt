Difference between Static and Non Staic Mebers in Java:-
1.Static members load when then complingn start of program.
but non-staic mebers load wehen then we create object and and call them;

exp-
public class Studens{

int test=0;
static int test2= 10;
public void fun(a+b){
return a+b;
}
static public void fun2(a+b){
return a+b;
} 
 
static public void main(String[] args){
System.out.println(test)//this will through an error becuse we want to ascess those members those are not loded in the program;
System.out.println(test2)//this will not through any error because static member are load when program start compling;
fun(1,2)//this will also through error because this is a non-staic member;
fun2(1,2)//this will not through any error because this is static member;

}
}

2.We create static member when any member are used in the program very extensively;
We create non-static member when use of a member in program in less time;

3. If we want to ascess static member we can direct ascess them by there name;
but if we want to ascess non-static member we need to createe an object and by using those object then we can ascess them

exp-

public class Studens{

int test=0;
static int test2= 10;
public void fun(a+b){
return a+b;
}
static public void fun2(a+b){
return a+b;
} 
 
static public void main(String[] args){
Students obj=new Students();
System.out.println(obj.test)//using object we can ascess non-static members;
System.out.println(test2)
obj.fun(1,2)//using object we can ascess non-static members;
fun2(1,2)

}
}
